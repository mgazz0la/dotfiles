# mgazz0la dotfiles

TODO: Add a screenshot here.

This repo follows the [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) style of dotfile management. This approach

directory to track your dotfiles directly in version control.

TODO: Add detailed instructions on how to properly clone this repo.
